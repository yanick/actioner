Revision history for actioner 

1.0.0 2018-10-19
    - move tests to jest.
    - remove integration with store and dispatch (was trying to be too clever).

0.2.0 2017-04-24
    - change 'generator' for 'creator' in the docs.
    - rename helper functions from _foo to $foo.
    - add schema_include.

0.1.1 2016-10-13
    - dispatch_* functions were only acknowledging their first argument.

0.1.0 2016-09-16
    - Add dispatch helpers.
    - Can set the actions to be immutable.
    - Add raw generators ($foo).
    - Couldn't add a second action if validation is enabled 
        (because it was trying to add the schema without
        removing it).
