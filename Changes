0.1.1 2016-10-13
    - dispatch_* functions were only acknowledging their first argument.

0.1.0 2016-09-16
    - Add dispatch helpers.
    - Can set the actions to be immutable.
    - Add raw generators ($foo).
    - Couldn't add a second action if validation is enabled 
        (because it was trying to add the schema without
        removing it).
